3. Spawn passengers for Monday (full day):
   > seed 1 monday 0-23
   
4. View manifest with time filter:
   > manifest 1 2024-11-04 7-9
   
5. Visualize distribution:
   > barchart 1
   
6. Selective cleanup:
   > delete route=1 hours=0-6       (delete night passengers)
   
7. Check result:
   > barchart 1
