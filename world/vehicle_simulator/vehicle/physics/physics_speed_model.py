"""Physics Speed Model Adapter

Internal canonical units:
    - Kernel state velocity (v) is meters/second (m/s)
    - Acceleration is meters/second^2

We now standardize the simulation INTERNALLY on SI units (m/s) and only
convert to km/h at the *telemetry emission* layer. The Engine previously
assumed km/h and integrated distance using (v * dt)/3600. After the unit
normalization patch, Engine integrates using m/s directly and stores
cruise_speed_mps in the buffer.

This adapter returns velocity in m/s under key `velocity_mps` (and for
legacy compatibility still provides `velocity` == m/s). Downstream code
should prefer `velocity_mps` when present.

Vehicle performance characteristics are now loaded from database by reg_code,
with fallback to environment variables and defaults.
