# Vehicle Simulator - Project Status & Roadmap

## 🎯 Current State (September 2025)

### ✅ **COMPLETED - Major Architecture Transformation**

#### 🏗️ **Architecture Overhaul**
- **Database-Driven Fleet Management**: Completely migrated from file-based to PostgreSQL database operations

- **Plugin System**: Fully functional navigator_telemetry plugin architecture
- **Real-time API Monitoring**: Socket.IO connection monitoring with automatic reconnection

#### 🔧 **Core Components Implemented**
- **VehiclesDepot**: Database-driven fleet operations with dual scheduling modes
- **FleetDataProvider**: Unified data access layer for vehicles, routes, drivers, schedules
- **TimetableScheduler**: Dual-mode scheduler supporting both time-based and capacity-based operations
- **Navigator Refactoring**: Pure data consumer, accepts route coordinates directly
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time API status monitoring with fixed SimpleClient implementation

#### 📊 **Enhanced Monitoring & Status**
- **Countdown Timers**: Ready for vehicle departure scheduling (both modes)
- **Resource Availability**: Real-time tracking of vehicles, routes, drivers
- **Detailed Status Display**: Comprehensive system status with neutral messaging
- **API Connection Status**: Live monitoring of fleet manager connectivity

#### 🚐 **ZR Van Capacity-Based Scheduling (NEW!)**
- **Realistic ZR Van Operations**: Vehicles depart when full OR after max wait time
- **Passenger Boarding Simulation**: Automatic passenger arrival simulation
- **Dual Mode Support**: Toggle between capacity-based (ZR style) and time-based (traditional) scheduling
- **Barbados-Specific Logic**: Default 11-passenger capacity with configurable max wait times
- **Live Boarding Status**: Real-time passenger count and boarding progress monitoring

#### 🛠️ **Database Schema Integration**
- Fixed all attribute mapping issues (reg_code, license_no, employment_status, etc.)
- Proper SQLAlchemy model integration
- Database session management through FleetManager

### 📈 **Current Capabilities**
- ✅ 6 vehicles available in database
- ✅ 4 drivers available in database  
- ✅ Fleet Manager API connected
- ✅ Timetable scheduler operational (dual-mode)
- ✅ **Capacity-based scheduling** for ZR van operations
- ✅ Real-time passenger boarding simulation
- ✅ Plugin system functional
- ✅ Real-time status monitoring
- ⚠️ 0 routes designated (expected - waiting for next phase)
- ⚠️ No timetable set (expected - waiting for next phase)

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS - Immediate Priorities**

### 🎯 **Phase 1: Timetable & Route Implementation**
**Target**: Next development session

#### 📅 **Database Seeding**
- [ ] Add route data to database
  - [ ] Route geometries and coordinates
  - [ ] Route metadata (short_name, long_name, colors)
  - [ ] Route stops and stop times
- [ ] Create vehicle timetables
  - [ ] Vehicle-to-route assignments
  - [ ] Scheduled departure times
  - [ ] Service patterns (daily, weekdays, weekends)
- [ ] Driver assignments
  - [ ] Driver-to-vehicle-to-route scheduling
  - [ ] Shift patterns and rotations

#### ⏰ **Live Countdown System**
- [ ] Test countdown timers with real schedules
- [ ] Verify automatic vehicle activation
- [ ] Monitor "Next departure: Vehicle X on Route Y at HH:MM:SS (in Xm Ys)"
- [ ] Validate schedule-driven operations

#### 🚐 **Vehicle Operations**
- [ ] Test Navigator with real route coordinates
- [ ] Verify GPS telemetry transmission
- [ ] Monitor vehicle state transitions
- [ ] Validate plugin data collection

- [ ] **Driver Break Management**: Automatic driver shift changes and breaks
- [ ] **Vehicle Maintenance Scheduling**: Preventive maintenance based on mileage/hours
- [ ] **Fuel Management**: Fuel consumption tracking and refueling schedules

### 🎯 **Phase 3: Real-time Analytics**
- [ ] **Performance Metrics**: On-time performance, delay analysis
- [ ] **Passenger Load Simulation**: Capacity utilization tracking
- [ ] **Route Optimization**: AI-driven route efficiency recommendations
- [ ] **Predictive Analytics**: Demand forecasting and capacity planning

### 🎯 **Phase 4: Advanced Integrations**
- [ ] **Weather Integration**: Weather-based schedule adjustments
- [ ] **Traffic API Integration**: Real-time traffic-aware routing
- [ ] **Mobile App Interface**: Real-time passenger information system
- [ ] **IoT Sensor Integration**: Real vehicle telemetry (if available)

### 🎯 **Phase 5: Multi-Depot Operations**
- [ ] **Multi-Depot Support**: Multiple depot locations and coordination
- [ ] **Inter-depot Transfers**: Vehicle movement between depots
- [ ] **Regional Fleet Management**: City-wide or country-wide operations
- [ ] **Cross-depot Resource Sharing**: Dynamic vehicle/driver allocation
