"""
Depot-Based Vehicle Simulation Test

This test demonstrates the proper integration flow:
1. Initialize depot system (connects to Fleet Manager API)
2. Dispatcher fetches vehicle/driver/route assignments 
3. Routes are distributed to drivers with GPS coordinates
4. Drivers board vehicles and activate GPS devices
5. Engines turn on and vehicles move along real route coordinates
6. GPS telemetry is transmitted to telemetry server

This uses the proper depot workflow instead of manually creating drivers.
